# Language Server Manager (LSM)

[![ci](https://github.com/johejo/lsm/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/johejo/lsm/actions?query=workflow%3Aci)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/johejo/lsm/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/johejo/lsm)

## Motivation

Language Server is difficult to set up and is tightly coupled with each editor plugin.<br>
https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp/issues/200#issuecomment-618807759

There are also lots of scripts to support different platforms and Language Servers, which is becoming difficult to maintain.<br>
https://github.com/mattn/vim-lsp-settings/tree/master/installer

LSM aims to be a simple and cross platform installation manager for Language Server.

## Notice
Windows support is still incomplete.
